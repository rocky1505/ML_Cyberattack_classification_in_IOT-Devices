We trained the model using Random forest, Logistic Regression, XG Boost and CNN.

I simulated a attack with Hping3 tool from Kali linux to simulate an attack from an virtual machine onto my main device.

Then we captured the data packets with wireshark and we seperated the attackers data packet.

Then we pre-processed the data sample and converted the sample into CSV with the help of ***TCPDUMP_and_CICFlowMeter-master*** tool.

We created another python script to use this newly created csv and imported the pickle files and h5 files of the models. 

This project works well with real like situations on models like XGBoost, Random forest and CNN
